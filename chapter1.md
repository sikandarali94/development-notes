# Execution Contexts and Lexical Environments



### Syntax Parsers, Execution Contexts and Lexical Environments

* **Syntax Parser**: A program that reads your code and determines what it does and if its grammar is valid e.g. compilers and interpreters.
* **Lexical Environment**: Where something sits physically in the code you write. 'Lexical' means 'having to do with words or grammar'. A lexical environment exists in programming languages in which **where** you write something is important.
* **Execution Context**: A wrapper to help manage the code that is running. There are lots of lexical environments. Which one is currently running is managed via execution contexts. It can contain things beyond what we've written in our code.
