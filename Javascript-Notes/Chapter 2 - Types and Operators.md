# Types and Operators

### Types and Javascript \(Conceptual\)

* **Dynamic Typing**: We don't tell the engine what type of data a variable holds, it figures it out while our code is running. In Javascript, variables can hold different types of values because it's all figured out during execution.
* In many other languages we have to specify the variable type explicitly. This is called **Static Typing**.
* If we don't know how Javascript makes a decision when figuring out the type of variable, this can cause us many issues.
