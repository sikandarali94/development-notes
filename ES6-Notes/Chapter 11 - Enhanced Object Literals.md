# Enhanced Object Literals

### Enhanced Object Literals

* Enhanced object literals are all about writing out object literals in a more compact fashion. This is **syntactic sugar**.
* First feature of an enhanced object literal is if the key and value have the exact same name like this: `inventory: inventory`,. We can condense this down to just `inventory,`.
