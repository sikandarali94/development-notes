# ECMAScript and Javascript

### Introduction

* ECMAScript is the **standard**. Javascript is the **implementation**. ES6 is the newest implementation of Javascript.
* We have to assume that the majority of users don't have full support for ES6 code or standard. Therefore we write ES6 code and transpile it through **Babel** into ES5 code.
